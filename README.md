Project description:
This project studies the interaction between PsbS and the proteins CP24, CP26, CP29, and CP43, as well as the entire PSII-LHCII supercomplex, using the following methods:
-Contact analysis
-Lifetime analysis
-Cluster analysis

The starting structures are generated using:
-DAFT (for CP24, CP26, CP29, and CP43)
-Output from the cluster analysis (for the PSII-LHCII supercomplex)
